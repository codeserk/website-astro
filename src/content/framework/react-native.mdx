Recently adopted, this technology on its own makes learning React a must.

One of the reasons I started learning [](framework/react) was to use this technology. I have developed other mobile applications like [I Ching](project/i-ching) using web technologies like [](framework/ionic), but this is on a **whole different level**.
This lib allows you to create **NATIVE** iOS/Android apps. When I was developing apps with Ionic I thought that there wouldn't be such a big difference between Native and Ionic apps, but oh boy if I was wrong.

I started using this lib in 2021, while working as Freelance, mainly doing mobile apps for iOS and Android.
