This was my main frontend framework, where reactivity looked like magic.

Failed to try [nolink,simple](framework/vue) + [nolink,simple](language/typescript)

## Why?

By the time Vue 3 was _stable_ and was supposed to work well with [](language/typescript) I was already working with [](framework/react), since that was the best way to achieve mobile apps using (using [](framework/react-native)).

I still think [](framework/vue)'s implementation of reactivity is superior to [simple](framework/react)'s... but now it's too late - and I really appreciate the fact that it's plain [simple](language/typescript), instead of adding another abstraction layer on top of the language like in [simple](framework/vue)
