I've been using this framework for some, trying to make static sites simpler.

**DISCLAIMER**: Probably soon to _judge_ this technology.

## Why

I've been using other frameworks for the web:

- [](framework/nuxt) when I used [](framework/vue)
- [](framework/nextjs) when I started using [](framework/react)

But, while it makes sense for `PWA`, business applications, and such; it's weird to have a _reactive framework_ to render something that you know it's going to be 100% static. **TOO MUCH JS!**

That's when I read about Astro, and unless something bad has happened, [this website](project/codeserk) is built using it!

## What

While still being a _framework_, with their own `.astro` and all that, their approach is quite different. I think some people call it _meta framework_ :/

The trick is that the main functionality is to _do stuff in TS_ that will render **plain HTML/CSS/JS**. No hydration. ~~No hydration~~ by default, just when you want dynamic components.

The approach for this is also quite nice, you can use any of the top frameworks like [](framework/react) or [](framework/vue) and add it to your website.

## Downside

Like [](framework/nextjs), I have the feeling that they are trying to become the _next PHP_, pls stop :(. The motivation seems to be again related to _selling cloud stuff_. I hope all the `backend-in-my-frontend` stuff remains optional.
