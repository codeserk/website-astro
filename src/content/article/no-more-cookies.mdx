I've removed the annoying popup for the cookies. Why? because I won't use cookies anymore!

I've started using [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io/) to gather usage statistics. This tool is not using cookies at all, and claims to be healthier for our privacy!
I'll give it a try, but not adding _trash_ to people's cookies **feels great :)**
