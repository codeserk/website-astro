I've started learning `GoLang`, and I'm quite amazed by it! (sorry for the _pun_ in the title).

GoLang embraces simplicity: _create clean and simple code, and see it running faster than light_ :)
This is language can deliver really efficient code in both speed and memory usage. It's a game changer (at least when it's compared with NodeJS). We are talking a difference in _scale_: if we measure NodeJS API durations in _seconds_, (`0.2s`, `0.5s`), we measure `GoLang`'s in `milliseconds` (`0.5ms`, `2ms`) :upsidedown:.

The language itself can look _ugly_ at first, and you might think it's lacking some features (`OOP` stuff seems _limited_), but while I'm learning this language I'm realising that it's like that for a good reason. The language adopts some concepts from classic `OOP` languages, like `interfaces` but it prevents you from making overcomplicated code. _Inheritance_ is fun, yep; but it can often lead to complex (and difficult to manage) code. Thus, this wise _gopher_ won't allow you to do that.

Some of these questions are still unanswered for me, but at least I've seen already that **there is a way to design stuff right**, it's just done differently. And, of course, good old web architecture patterns apply here too so it's not all chaos :D

## Learning

I've started learning from Go documentation (with examples, and a tour), and I've started a [dummy project](https://github.com/codeserk/training-go) to see the progress. I've bought [this book](https://www.gopl.io/) too, which should help me understanding the reasons behind all the decisions that were made.

[This article](https://eminetto.medium.com/clean-architecture-using-golang-b63587aa5e3f) worked well as starting point to create a _clean architecture_ (based on well-tested web architecture designs).

_Way to **Go**_ I guess :)
