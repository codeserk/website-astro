_Oh boy this database_. I'm probably biased by my own experience but I'd rather skip this database if possible ğŸ˜–.

## Update

As it turns out, it was not because the database _was bad or anything_. It was all our fault (not a big _surprise_).

Use this database as it's meant to be used and is really powerful in some situations.
