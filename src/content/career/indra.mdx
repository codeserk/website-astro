This was one of my _first jobs_, definitely the first one in a large company. I started working for this company when I started the 4th year of my degree in `Computer Science`.

As you can imagine, I had a lot to learn, and this was a good opportunity for me to connect all the theory learnt in college with _real-life experience_. I worked as a Backend and Frontend developer.

The main framework we used for the Backend was [](framework/j2ee), using `Hibernate` for the database communication. This was _2010_, so what we had in the Frontend was not beautiful, it was before `jQuery` was very popular.
