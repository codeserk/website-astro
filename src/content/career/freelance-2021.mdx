The **risk is higher**, since they have very high expectations on you, and your work. The **reward is also higher** though. If you succeed, the feeling of accomplishment feels great: it sounds truly sincere when someone that is paying for individual tasks is happy about the outcome of your work. It cannot be _team effort_, _company-wide success_; **it was you and your work what made the customer happy!**

For now I'm working for one main customer, doing [](react) and [](react-native) apps, and another customer for which we are delivering a full [](web) solution (using [](nestjs) and [](react)).

## React / React Native applications

I started these projects early this year. It was actually a good opportunity for me to learn [](react) and [](react-native) ([](vue) was my main frontend framework until then).

## Web solution (details to be unveiled)

For this project I'm working with a friend: he takes care of the backend using [](nestjs), and I take care of the frontend(s) using [](react) (and maybe [](react-native) in the future).
I really like this project, since it gives me the opportunity to test my skills in a complete greenfield (no legacy, yay!).
Besides, working with friends is always nice!
