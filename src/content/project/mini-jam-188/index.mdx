You wake up in a dark interrogation room. A single bulb flickers overhead. Red eyes watch from the shadows.

Examine damning evidence that reveals how ordinary people destroy the lives of those they love most.

In this noir mystery, every piece of evidence tells a story of guilt. The question is: can you handle the truth?

## A **mystery** game

- Theme: _Mystery_
- Limitation: _All in a box_

This was the 3rd game I make for a game jam with [Arthur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurmtro/). This time it was quite ea challenge: _mystery_ theme didn't resonate with the typical action games we make. This time it was going to be a _detective game_: read evidences, think a bit, deduce what is going on.

For this game we decided to use AI (a low-cost, efficient model) for the player to check if they have actually solved the case. That was actually a lot of fun to implement, we had to tweak a lot the context so it didn't make the player experience miserable.
