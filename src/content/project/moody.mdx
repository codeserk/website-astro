A card game to improve team collaboration.

This was an idea from some of my colleges at [Coosto](/career/coosto). The original idea was from our scrum master and one of our designers: they wanted to create a _social game_ to improve the atmosphere within a team.

I'm afraid we couldn't finish the game, and now **I even forgot the rules D:**. But I want to come back to this project soon!
