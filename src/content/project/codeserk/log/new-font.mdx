I've changed the font of the website, and I think this one looks way better than the old one.

The old one was `DOS` font, and is quite nice and easy to read, but this has more personality. The `DOS` font is still used for code blocks, to improve readability:

```ts
const isEasyToRead = true
if (!isEasyToRead) {
  return 'D:'
}
```

## New font

I found the new font by chance, I was looking for a new game to play, when I found out that I had `itch.io` app installed. I looked for games, but I found many assets instead!. Apparently I have many assets from the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality
](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) (from 2020). And one of said assets included _this font_: [Humble Fonts Gold](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-gold).

So the creator(s) of my new font is up for good causes, which feels nice :)
