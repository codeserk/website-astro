I'm moving from [](framework/nuxt) ([](framework/vue)) to [](framework/astro).

**FUN FACT**: I was not able to update the website because it was built with [](framework/vue) and some dependencies were outdated, or something... so the project wouldn't compile anymore D:
Because of that, the published website would still mention [](career/coosto) as my current job (_which is FALSE_).

This is still true by the time I'm writing this post :mildpanic:.

Anyhow, I'm moving from [](framework/nuxt) to [](framework/astro) because this tool seems quite appropriate for my website:

- Astro works great with static content (`.md`, `.mdx`)
- I don't need to have any reactivity framework
- Sounds fun!
