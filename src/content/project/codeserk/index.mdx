This website, my personal portfolio

The implementation of this website is an evolution of the implementation of [](project/avellana-colora). This public website uses [](project/press) library that I built in [](language/typescript).

The library reads all the content from the local filesystem (mostly from `markdown` files) and provides all scaffolding to build a public website. This application is built using [](framework/nuxt), which makes `SSG` easy as hell.
