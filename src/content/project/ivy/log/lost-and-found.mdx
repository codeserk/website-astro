I lost the source code of the game! D: - what happened next will surprise you!

I'm still not sure how this happened, but the fact is that I really lost the source code for thi game, even though it was _recently_ revamped it to showcase in the portfolio.
I thought that the source code was in [](framework/unity)'s _cloud code-thing_. But no /shrug. I downloaded the project and I found some Unity stuff + empty `/Assets` folder.

I panicked (a bit).

I checked in all the repositories I have (github, bitbucket, gitlab), but I couldn't find it!. Maybe the code was only locally... but I didn't have the same computers I had when working on it:

- My previous Mac **died dramatically** (weird screen flickering). So I formatted it a few times to try to fix --> nothing to be found there.
- My previous _linux_ desktop pc was gone, I sold/gave it away.
- Nothing to be found in my current computers (Mac for working, or Windows for gaming).

My last hope was to check in some old _hard drives_ I have. And yes! It was in the _hard drive_ from my previous windows computer \o/.
It seems to be a version before the revamp, so I'll need to deal with an annoying Unity migration again... but it's something :D.
