Mobile game to dodge _Asteroids_!

![full bordered md alt:Asteroids! Header](/project/ivy/featured.png)

**Asteroids!** is a game I made using [](framework/unity), where I was responsible for all the assets, excerpt for the music (clearly the best thing in the game), which was made by my sister in law :)

The main mechanic of the game is quite easy: dodge asteroids while the speed (and the music) keeps accelerating with every new level.

This was my first game released, and I learnt a lot from the whole process (from _designing_ to _publishing in the android market_).
