The implementation of this website was an evolution of the implementation of [AJ+B website](project/angelaberenguer).

This public website uses [Press](project/press) library that I built in [](language/typescript). The library reads all the content from a [](technology/wordpress) instance and provides all scaffolding to build a public website. This application is built using [](framework/nuxt), which makes `SSG` easy as hell.
