  raw: Unity game for _Ludum Dare 25_
---

This was the first [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/) where I participated. I developed a game with my two brothers (David and [Alejandro Cámara](http://acamara.es/)), and it was a lot of fun (quite **stressful** though).

There is more information about this game in [my brother's website](http://www.acamara.es/gamedev/ld25/)

> This game was designed and implemented during the 72 hours of the jam of the 25th edition of Ludum Dare. It is an Action RPG in which you fight the evil witch that attacks your town. It has been made in collaboration with Jose and David Cámara Iglesias.

There's one thing I will never forget after building this game: **BE AWARE OF GARBAGE COLLECTORS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL**. I was _young and unexperienced_:

We freed/allocated some memory during the scenes

--> that triggered the garbage collector

--> the game **froze for some seconds**.

I used to blame [](language/java) for that, but it was actually our fault (:
