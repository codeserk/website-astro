  raw: A game for **programmers** (or that was the _idea_)!
---

This was project that was initiated by my brother [Alejandro CÃ¡mara](http://acamara.es/), and I joined to help with some [](development/web) technologies. The idea was to create an `AI` that could be programmed by the player. The goal of this `AI` was to navigate a _maze_ that was generated procedurally.

- My brother built the **core** of the project. It was built in [](language/cpp), and was responsible generating the _mazes_ and parsing the `Lua` code from the player which would guide the `AI` through the map.
- I was responsible for building the [](development/web) infrastructure so it was possible to visualize how the `AI` (the dot) was moving through the map. It consisted of a backend that had a `socket` connection with the [](language/cpp) program and `websocket` connection with the active users.

This was a very interesting project, but it has some design flaws. I would like to give it a try somewhere in the future (if I ever have time for that...)
