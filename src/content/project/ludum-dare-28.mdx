Unity game for _Ludum Dare 28_

This is a game I developed for the 28th edition of [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/). It was made in 72h by me and my brother David CÃ¡mara.

I'm afraid this was built using a very old version of [](framework/unity), so I was barely able to make it run again to take some screenshots.
