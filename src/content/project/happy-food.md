---

This is a project I'm working in collaboration with [my brother](https://acamara.es). The idea is simple: you configure some questions about a product/service with a few possible answers.

> How was the food?

- Bad
- Meh
- Great!

Once the question is set, you _block_ with the question and you expect feedback from the people that comes by.

I'm going to use [](framework/ionic) to make this project, since the constraints are very similar to [I-Ching](project/i-ching)'s app (so it should do the trick!).
