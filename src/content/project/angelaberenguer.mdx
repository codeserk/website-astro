Angela Berenguer's brand portfolio. This public website uses a library that I built in [](language/php) which is very similar to [Press](project/press).

The library reads all the content from a [](technology/wordpress) instance and provides all scaffolding to build a public website. It uses [Corcel library](https://github.com/corcel/corcel) behind the scene. The final application is built in [](framework/laravel).

The main _problem_ of this implementation is that it requires a _live app_ (apart from the _CMS_) running in order to make this work. In the new implementation (using [](project/press)), I make use of `SSG` so it's possible to serve just static content.
