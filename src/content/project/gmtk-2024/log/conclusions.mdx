We didn't actually have the time to discuss some conclusions, or have some kind of `post-mortem`... but more or less we agreed on some conclusions.

- **Too much texts is bad for jams**: This is something I really forgot, but when you are playing other people's games in the jam, you have no time to read long tutorials. Game must be easy to understand, because you will be testing many many games. Be real, people won't read it. It's always better to have some graphics explaining what's going on / what to do.
- **Make it clear**: It's crazy how many things seem super obvious to the developers and then is cryptic for real players. Having some testes might help in the new games.
- **It should be fun**: We made a simulation, and lacks some more interaction. Prioritizing _making it fun_ could be better for next ones!.
- **Having an artist helps**: It was a lot of fun to see how our ideas became something that looks nice!

TBH I'm writing this some time after the jam so I might be missing something /shrug
