This was the first day! Lots of ideas, and nerves. It was not our first jam game (I even did other jams with my brother [Ale](https://miguel2x4004.artstation.com/)), but it was the first one with my cousin [Miguel](https://miguel2x4004.artstation.com/). The first one with a _proper_ designer!.

**00:00am** (around 19:00pm in Spain) - The theme was announced!

## **Build to Scale**

It was a bit disappointing actually, not terrible theme but we were hoping for a more abstract theme like _you are the villain_, but it is what it is.

I had _super weird idea_, in the world of [](/development/web):

> What if you had to maintain something that acts like a database cluster, but using workers.
> You can get more more workers, stronger workers, distribute load in different workspaces... (didn't convince many people with it).

We had some other ideas for _puzzle games_ where the scale changed somehow:

- Maybe you have a potion to change your size
- Maybe you have another potion to change also weight
- ...

But this wasn't great either.

My brother had an idea about a cooking game, where you started with atom-level stuff (he actually mentioned something that I don't understand (he's physics), but let's assume something super small) - and you **ended up cooking galaxies**!. The idea wasn't bad but we were thinking how to make that fun...

The final idea came a bit later:

> Let's **simulate a world**, with different species and let's see if we can make them _live together in balance_.

And there was the idea for our jam game!
