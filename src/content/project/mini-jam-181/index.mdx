In a world of towering animal customers, you're just a small rabbit running your neighborhood coffee shop.

## Small Paws, Cozy Brews!

Tend to your counter, hire a friendly helper, upgrade your equipment, and create a warm, inviting caf√©

Watch your little coffee corner grow as you serve up comforting brews to your regular customers, showing that even the smallest creature can create something special

Created by me and [Arthurmtro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurmtro/) for Mini Jam 181 in a weekend. The jam theme was _Rabbit_ with the limitation _The player is the weakest creature_

We brought this to life by making you a tiny shop owner creating your own cozy corner in a world of much larger animals !
