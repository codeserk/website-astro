Last day of development: time to finish everything and hope it compiles (spoiler: it didn't).

## Final Game Loop

Arthur finished the last sprites and music, and I finished the game loop and UI.

The game was there, just _some things_ were missing. After some work, we finished the last details like animations and balanced the game so it ended in about 5 minutes. And that's it, we had the game:

Didn't we?

## Ok, Let's Compile

It was like 4 hours before closing time, so we had time. Let's do it! We compiled the game, and it built after some _silly mistakes_. But when we ran it...
**NULL POINTER EXCEPTION**. The game crashed just after it started, with no `stacktrace`, and no way to know what was going on.

Then we were like 2 hours debugging and testing things. _What can be wrong?_ It was tricky: the game ran perfectly in the [Unity](/framework/unity) editor, but didn't work when compiling. The biggest problem was that each change we tested meant building to know if it worked.

After building with `stacktraces`, we had a clue: It was about a `ScriptableObject` for resources that was not being loaded. **PANIC**. Now what? We didn't have that much defined in resources (2 products, 1 appliance, and 2 customers), so we decided to ditch that and initialize them manually in code. This was _5 AM_, 1 hour before closing time, but **IT WORKED!**. We had a running version on itch.io:
