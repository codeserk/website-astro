First day of the jam, mostly to discuss what kind of game we want to build. Spoiler: _cozy game_!

import Image from '~/components/Content/Image.astro'

This was the first day of the Jam, but we didn't really work a lot that day, since it started at 5am for us and we couldn't work this day (Friday). We met at around 9pm and discussed what to do.

- Theme: _Bunnies_.
- Limitation: _You are the weakest creature_.

We thought about multiple things that could work well with the theme and limitation:

- **Tower defense**, you are a weak rabbit in your hide, and then you need to protect yourself by adding some rabbit-themed defensive weapons.
- **Stealth game** where the rabbit needs to use its senses (better hearing, for example) to avoid other strong animals.
- ... other ideas that I don't remember (I guess they weren't so good).

Then Arthur had a super good idea, based on a mobile game he was playing: A cozy management game where you (the rabbit) prepare food/drinks for customers. The use of the limitation would be that you are the weakest creature in the game (some big/strong animals would come as customers). The idea was to show that not being strong doesn't mean you can't be helpful or kind.

## Inspiration

The main inspiration for our game was a mobile game about cats preparing coffee:

## First steps

Once the idea was clear, we started to work on it!.

- I took care of the _development_ in [](framework/unity)
- Arthur took care of the _Sprites_ and _Music_.

We formed an awesome team!

I started working on _boring_ stuff like state machines for the game logic.

### First sprites

It was around 2am when Arthur presented the first sprites, this is awesome!!

  <Image src="/project/mini-jam-181/day-1/bull-1.png" alt="margin-auto sm:w-64 sm:h-64 bordered md alt:First version of the bull pixelated" />
</div>

### First prototype

At around 3am we added the first visual representation of the coffee shop!

We also had the first version of the state machine + path finding (but that's more _boring_ to show).
