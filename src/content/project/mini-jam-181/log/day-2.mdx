Main day for development. Everything was decided so big coffee and _let's go!_

## First animated sprites

Next day Arthur already had some amazing pixel-art animations!

<div class="flex flex-wrap align-center justify-between">
  <Image src="/project/mini-jam-181/day-2/bull-idle.gif" alt="center sm:w-64 h-100 alt:First version of the bunny" />

  <Image src="/project/mini-jam-181/day-2/bull-sitting.gif" alt="center sm:w-64 h-100 alt:First h-auto version of the bull pixelated" />
</div>

And he was starting to work on the bubbles (so indicate what the customers wanted):

## New inspiration

At some point in the day we had an existential crisis:

- Should we do animations for all directions? Should they just look down? Will that look weird?
- Should we place the counter in the bottom and the customers come from the top, or reverse?

We decided to move to the new layout after checking some examples that looked really nice. Our fear: Do we need to implement animations of customers facing up now (when they go to the counter)?

## Next prototype

After some tests, we realized that we didn't need to make all the animations, sprites facing down look good even when they walk up.

This is the last prototype for the game we made this day. Almost everything was set up, we just needed to polish it!
