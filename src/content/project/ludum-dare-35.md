  raw: Unity game for _Ludum Dare 35_
---

This is a game I developed for the 35th edition of [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/). It was made in 72h by me and my brother David CÃ¡mara.

David was responsible for the art, which has some charm (I think we got some positive feedback in that area).
