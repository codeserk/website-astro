Game result from the GMTK from 2024.
_ExpPopulation_.

I participated in the [GMTK 2024](https://alecamara.itch.io/gmtk2024) game jam with my cousin [Miguel](https://miguel2x4004.artstation.com/) and my brother [Ale](https://www.alecamara.com/en/). _Miguel_ was taking care of all the art, which was great! It was nice to have a **proper artist** in a jam (instead of just trying to do something ourselves _non-artist devs_).

We we able to deliver a game in 48h (we had to work so we couldn't use the full time of the jam). The result can be seen in this website or in [itch.io](https://alecamara.itch.io/gmtk2024)
