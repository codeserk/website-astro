Game result from the GMTK from 2025. _MOEBIUS INFINITO!_.

I participated in the [GMTK 2025](https://alecamara.itch.io/gmtk2025) game jam with my cousin [Miguel](https://miguel2x4004.artstation.com/) and my brother [Ale](https://www.alecamara.com/en/). Just like previous year ([](/project/gmtk-2024)), it was a lot of fun working with them!

Miguel's art is getting better and better, and that was key for the final result of our game. We also put more efforts into the audio (effects + music). And this time the game was _actually fun_. Simple concept: Race in a _Moebius strip_, **FOREVER** --> **MOEBIUS INFINITO**!
