This was an app I _tried_ to develop during my 6 months as [freelance](career/freelance-2015).

In this app you would be able to share your thoughts with the people nearby. I used [](framework/sailsjs) as main Framework for the Backend, using [](database/mongodb) for persistence and [](database/redis) for cache. The first approach was to develop a single web Frontend using [](framework/angular-1), and make that work in mobile devices using [](technology/phonegap). But oh boy, if that was buggy:

- The application was highly dependant on [](technology/websockets), and that didn't work very well with embedded web apps.
- I put a lot of efforts to make the website `responsive`, but the UX was not great, you could easily tell that it was just a website pretending to be an app.

Having that in mind, I decided to start implementing a native [](development/android) app, which was fun to learn, but also a big stone in the path.

This project was a **big failure** for many reasons, but I'm happy of all the things I could learn during this time :) Besides, I was able to present all the work I had done in this project during my interview for a position at [Square 1](career/square1) (which showed that I had some experience in [](development/web)), so it was helpful after all!
