Web application to consult the _I-ching_ Oracle.

![xl:w-64 xl:float-left display-block xl:mr-4 alt:I-Ching application logo](/project/i-ching/logo.png)

This is a simple project: Create an app that allows users to consult the [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) oracle.

This application is built using [](framework/react-native), and for now is published in [](development/android).

This application was _initially_ built using [](framework/ionic), a framework to create apps for [](development/android), [](development/ios) and [](development/web), but I migrated to [](framework/react-native) to improve the user experience.
