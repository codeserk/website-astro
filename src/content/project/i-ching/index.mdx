Web application to consult the _I-ching_ Oracle.

![xl:w-64 xl:float-left display-block xl:mr-4 alt:I-Ching application logo](/project/i-ching/logo.png)

This is a simple project: Create an app that allows users to consult the [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) oracle.

This application is built using [](framework/ionic), a framework to create apps for [](development/android), [](development/ios) and [](development/web). It uses a technology similar to [](technology/phonegap) behind the scenes, and it should do the trick for _small applications_ (that don't require special features like _realtime communications_ even when the app is in the background).

I've deployed the web version, and I'm preparing the releases for [](development/android) and [](development/ios). If the result is _good enough_ I will continue using this technology for other similar projects :)
