name: '#2 Ionic it is... how good will this work?'

I've been testing whether Ionic works as expected for all the platforms I'm targeting and... [](framework/ionic) it is!

For now I just have a very basic navigation using routes (_journal_, _oracle_, _settings_). I've tested some builds, to ensure this will work in all the platforms I'm targeting:

- I've generated a _normal_ build for [](development/web) ✅
- I've generated a build for [](development/android) ✅
- I've generated a build for [](development/ios) ✅

The results in mobile apps was **surprisingly good**! I couldn't tell that it was not a native app, it just looked and felt like one :). This was a good day!
