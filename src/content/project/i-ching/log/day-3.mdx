I've finished the main app flow. It's far from **ready**, but it's something! \o/

It's not possible to consult the Oracle, and you get a resulting Hexagram. All the graphics and some texts are missing tho, but at least it's possible to use it :)

I've implemented a `Random` function that takes the current timestamp into account. It also waits some random time between coin tosses. This should mean that the user has impact on the final result (since they decide _when to toss the coin_).
