After months of juggling my day job, life's curveballs, and countless cups of coffee, I'm thrilled to announce that the **new version of my I-Ching Oracle app** is officially live!

## What's New in This Version?

Here are some of the key features and improvements I've added based on your feedback and my vision to make this app even more meaningful:

### 📖 Modernized, Gender-Neutral Texts

One of the biggest changes is a complete review and update of the texts. The I-Ching's wisdom is now presented in a more **modern, inclusive, and easy-to-understand language**, making it accessible to everyone. The messages retain their timeless depth but are now clearer and resonate with a broader audience.

### 🌟 Hexagram Glossary

Dive deeper into the wisdom of the I-Ching! The new Glossary feature allows you to explore the 64 hexagrams in detail. Use it to enhance your readings or study the profound symbolism behind each hexagram.

### 🎲 Three Ways to Toss the Coins

Now, you can choose how to consult the oracle:

- Toss coins one at a time.
- Toss all three coins simultaneously.
- Use real coins and manually input the results.

### 📒 Enhanced Journal

Your readings are precious moments of insight. In this version, you can:

- Add notes to your readings.
- Organize entries with tags.
- Rate your readings to track which guidance resonated most with you.

### ⚙️ More Personalization Options

Want to see less or more in your results? You can now customize what's displayed: trigram details, quotes, descriptions—whatever helps you connect better with the I-Ching.

## Why It Took a While

Creating this update took longer than I anticipated. Like many indie developers, I had to balance app development with a full-time job, personal responsibilities, and the usual ups and downs of life. There were late nights and moments of doubt, but knowing how much this app means to many of you kept me going.

## Still Free, Forever

One thing hasn't changed: this app remains completely **free**.
No ads, no hidden costs, no tricks—just a pure tool to help you connect with the timeless wisdom of the I-Ching.

## Thank You for Your Support

I couldn't have done this without the encouragement and feedback from users like you. Every kind word, suggestion, and even constructive criticism has shaped this app into what it is today.

Let me know what you think of the new features! And as always, feel free to share your experiences with the app—I'd love to hear how it's helping you on your journey.
