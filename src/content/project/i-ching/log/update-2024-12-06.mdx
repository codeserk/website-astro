After dedicating time and effort to enhancing the user experience, I'm happy to share the details of the latest update for my I-Ching app.

The most notable improvements are focused on the _Coins_ feature.
I've revamped the **graphics and animations** to provide a more visually engaging experience.
Additionally, the interaction flow has been simplified: now, tossing the coins just requires a single tap.

These updates are intended to make using the app more intuitive!
