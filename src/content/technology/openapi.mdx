Great tool to provider a contract between the _Backend_ and the _Frontend_.

I've used this technology in all the projects that involve a server. For me, is the cleanest way to provider a strict contract between the _server_ and the _fronts_. With this technology you can auto-generate clients (in most languages), so you don't need to worry much about the `http` layer.
