Nice tool to ease the boring part when publishing mobile apps.

This tool is quite powerful and can be used even to generate screenshots from the apps. However, I've only used it so far to ease the process of publishing a mobile app:

- Increase app version.
- Publish app to stores.
- Publish app to codepush.
