> Can you pay for it? Then you are safe.

I've been using AWS cloud infrastructure for some time now. Some parts are quite nice, some parts seem overpriced resell of other (_sometimes open-sourced_) products. But lately I came to the conclusion that using this tool adds _business value_, like getting `ISO certified`. Using `AWS` also reduces headaches: things are simpler. There's no worry of _low-level_ problems like `unix updates`, `kubernetes migration` or anything like that.
