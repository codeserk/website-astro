This section will display my _professional career_. Shows all the steps I followed ~~to become a 10x engineer~~.

Not all the periods are companies (or not just one company), some periods I've worked on my own projects like [](career/freelance-2021) (which is what I like **the most** :))

**BEHOLD**: Some periods overlaps, so the sum of all the numbers won't necessarily give you the number of years I've been working!. Although that _does not matter much_, or does it?

**BEHOLD (2)**: Some periods mention the _boring_ labels companies normally use like _medior_, _senior_. I stopped doing that around `2021` to avoid putting myself into a sealed box. I'm thankful that these labels were not in use in my latest steps of my career!
