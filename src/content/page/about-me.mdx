Welcome to my personal *portfolio*!. This website is meant to showcase all the [projects](/project) I work on, and the new [technologies](/technology) or [languages](/language) I use.

I'm **Jos√© C√°mara** and I'm passionate about innovative technologies and computer programming.
Although the main focus of my career is [](development/web), I have acquired skills in other [development areas](/development), such as: [](development/game), [](development/android) and [](development/ios)

I love animals, and especially cats since we share many *personality perks* (:

These are my cats **Mia** and the siblings: **Misa** and **Odin**:
