The result of the 2nd blender tutorial video from [Joey Carlino](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeyCarlino)'s beginner videos

Thanks a lot of these videos, they are really useful for complete beginners!

This scene contains some complex techniques in blender (complex for me, there are probably super-basic) used to created some of the models like the bicycle's wheels. This was also the first model that I showed in the portfolio, so the model renderer was also created at this time.
