How to make a _nice-looking_ toon Tower in blender. Tutorial from [gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/blender-texture-painting)

I've learnt to:

- Model a low-poly _toon-style_ tower, using different tricks like mirrors

- My first time making textures:
  - Learnt to use **Multiply** for shadows and **Screen** for lights in texture painting.
  - Created special gold textures using **Color Dodge** (what a hack!).
  - Made some nice-looking wood textures, which was easier than I expected.

Making the textures was actually quite pleasant task, and apparently my iPad works great when mirroring screen (I can use the pencil with pressure control and such).
