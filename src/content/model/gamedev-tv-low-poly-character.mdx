Making a _nice-looking_ (or **weird** looking?) low-poly character in Blender.
Tutorial from [gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/blender-low-poly-characters).

In the last lesson I was able to make low-poly structure, and this was a bit more _challenging_: there are more things to think about when making a rigged character.

In this tutorial I was able to:

- Make low-poly characters, starting from simple forms and progressing to more complex ones
- Understand _topology_ and special techniques that make the models suitable for _rigging_
- Set up rigging to create different poses and animations

The process was quite interesting, especially learning about proper topology for character models. Understanding how geometry affects rigging and animation was particularly valuable.

The face was drawn by my partner and yes: **looks like a baby-man**! Maybe great for `PSX-like horror game`?
